You want a calming, energy-based mobile app planner designed for chronically ill users and busy moms, prioritizing simplicity, flexibility, and emotional safety. Here's a plan for the initial version of the app:\n\n**Features for the First Version (MVP):**\n\n-   **Daily Check-In (Home Screen):** A simple screen where users can log their energy level (Low/Medium/High), symptoms, and mood. This will be the first screen users see upon opening the app.\n-   **Energy-Based Task Planning:** Users can add tasks and categorize them by energy cost (Low, Medium, High). Tasks can be marked as \"Optional,\" \"Must do,\" or \"Can wait.\"\n-   **Weekly Overview:** A screen displaying the week's energy trends and allowing users to drag and drop tasks between days.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n-   **Colors:**\n    -   Background: `#F8F8F8` (Very light gray)\n    -   Text: `#333333` (Dark gray)\n    -   TextSecondary: `#777777` (Medium gray)\n    -   Primary: `#A7C4BC` (Pastel green)\n    -   Secondary: `#E8DDCB` (Beige)\n    -   Accent: `#D5BDAF` (Light brown)\n    -   Card: `#FFFFFF` (White)\n    -   Highlight: `#F2E8CF` (Pale yellow)\n-   **Typography:** Use a modern, clean font like \"System\" for readability. Ensure large, readable text sizes.\n\n**Plan for Code Changes:**\n\n1.  **Project Structure:** The existing project structure will be used, focusing on modifying the `app/(tabs)` directory to implement the core features.\n2.  **Home Screen (`app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx`):**\n    -   Modify the existing home screen to include the Daily Check-In feature. This will involve adding UI elements for energy level selection (Low/Medium/High), symptom selection (fatigue, pain, brain fog, dizziness, anxiety), and mood selection (calm, overwhelmed, hopeful, tired, etc.).\n    -   The selections should be stored locally.\n    -   The `modalDemos` array should be removed from this file.\n3.  **Task Planning Screen (`app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx` and a new file `app/(tabs)/tasks/index.tsx`):**\n    -   Create a new screen for Energy-Based Task Planning.\n    -   Implement UI elements for adding tasks, categorizing them by energy cost (Low, Medium, High), and marking them as \"Optional,\" \"Must do,\" or \"Can wait.\"\n    -   Store tasks locally.\n4.  **Weekly Overview Screen (`app/(tabs)/weekly/index.tsx`):**\n    -   Create a new screen for the Weekly Overview.\n    -   Implement a week view that shows energy trends (this can be a simplified representation initially).\n    -   Allow users to drag and drop tasks between days.\n5.  **Navigation:**\n    -   Modify the tab navigation in `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx` to include tabs for the Home Screen, Task Planning Screen, and Weekly Overview Screen.\n\nNow, I will instruct the coding agent to implement this plan. After the implementation, the `modalDemos` array from `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx` should be removed.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-12-28T16:35:20.674813"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll start by searching the knowledge base for relevant information about React Native app development, local storage, and navigation patterns."}, {"type": "search_knowledge_base"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Now let me get the content of the AsyncStorage fragment to understand how to implement local storage:"}, {"type": "search_knowledge_base"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Now let me read the current project files to understand the structure:"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "styles/commonStyles.ts", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "components/FloatingTabBar.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Now let me search for icon names to use in the app:"}, {"type": "search_knowledge_base"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Perfect!

The battery can be divided into sections corresponding to the energy levels: Very Low, Low, Moderate, and High.\n*   **Interactive Selection:** Make each section of the battery tappable. When a user taps a section, it highlights that energy level.\n*   **State Management:** Use React's `useState` hook to manage the selected energy level.\n*   **Integration:** Connect this component to the daily check-in process, ensuring the selected energy level is stored correctly.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-12-28T18:04:53.053100"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll start by searching the knowledge base for relevant information about the issues you're experiencing, then examine the current code to fix the custom category functionality and implement the battery-style energy level check-in."}, {"type": "search_knowledge_base"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Now let me read the current code files to understand the structure and identify the issues:"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "app/(tabs)/tasks/index.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "utils/storage.ts", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "types/index.ts", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "styles/commonStyles.ts", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Now let me check the iOS-specific home screen file:"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "app/(tabs)/(home)/index.ios.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Perfect!
